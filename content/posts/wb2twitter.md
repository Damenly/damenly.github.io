#Sync sina weibo to twitter (multi images supported)
#同步微博到twitter (2021)

First of all, things needed:
* One twitter account with developer approved
* One linux machine
* One weibo account (of course)


1. get your weibo account url. e.g. https://weibo.com/u/2810373291
   and get rss address from https://rssfeed.today/weibo/
2. ssh your linux machine and follow instructions on 
   https://github.com/Damenly/wb2twitter
   
   
That's all. :)
